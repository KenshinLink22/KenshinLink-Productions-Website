            <p class = "update">The channel is going under a rebrand, from Last Bosses Films to KenshinLink Productions. This is to unassociate it from a dead channel and to make it sound less goofy, granted it still does.</p>

            <p class = "update">You may notice that there are many areas where the quality is bad compared to other recent stop motions. This is because in Stop Motion Studio Pro, whenever you go to erase parts of an image, the quality of the image you are editing drops significantly. There is a simple fix to this: before erasing anything, use the add tool (the opposite of erase) over the whole image, which restores its quality. This was also the first video I made with a green screen. A lot of erasing had to be done because I did not have proper lighting.</p>

            <p class = "update">This isn't my usual type fo videos, I just did this for my AP US History class. It did turn out as good practice for using VFX in iMovie. The next stop motion should be dropping soon.</p>
